Joseph founded LoFi Online back in July of 2019, but due to his lazy nature didn't do anything with it until more recently. He now writes most of the content while still retaining his lazy nature, and putting all the actual work on other people. After learning and listening to LoFi, he was surpirsed to see that there wasn't a website dedicated to the genre, and thus LoFi Online was born. He enjoys playing video games, holding unpopular opinions, and of course, listening to lofi.

Tyler joined LoFi Online in April of 2020 with the intention of using his "skills" as a programmer to improve the site and help it become successful. We have yet to see any improvment. Staying hopeful, Tyler continues to learn and improve his skills to further the site and make Joseph's life easier. Tyler is currently in college getting his degree in computer science. You can usually catch him playing video games, listening to music, or spending an absurd amount of money on custom mechanical keyboards.
