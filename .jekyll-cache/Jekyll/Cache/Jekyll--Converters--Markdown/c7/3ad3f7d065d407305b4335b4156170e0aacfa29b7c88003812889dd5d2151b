I"Ð<p>While this may come as a shock to some people, music is recorded via instruments. Contradicting my first statement (sort of) most people know that jazz is recorded with saxophones, cellos, drums and fedoras, while rock is recorded with electric guitars, drums, and hair mousse. While we tend to associate those instruments with those genres, things start to get blurred when talking about genres that incorporate electronic and sound mixing equipment/instruments. So that brings us to our post question which is as follows (not going to lie, I really didnâ€™t know how to end this paragraph so just go with it)</p>

<p><strong>What instruments are used in LoFi?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Piano</strong> â€“ It has such a wide array of sounds and rhythms that can go with almost any other sounds/rhythms</p>

<p><strong>DJ Mixer</strong> â€“ Used in everything from mixing sounds to scratching records</p>

<p><strong>Guitars</strong> â€“ From acoustic to electric, guitars are a staple of the genre</p>

<p><strong>Drums</strong> â€“ For keeping up the rhythm</p>

<p><strong>Microphones</strong> â€“ You have to record your hopefully more than mediocre voice somehow</p>

<p><strong>Computer</strong>â€“ Who wouldâ€™ve guessed? You can edit, create, and mix pretty much any sound in existence!</p>

<p><strong>Bongos</strong> â€“ For also keeping up the rhythm, just in a bit of a different sort of fashion</p>

<p><strong>Chimes</strong> â€“ Somehow they worked them into the music (donâ€™t ask me what I mean by that)</p>

<p>While there are at least twenty more, I really donâ€™t feel like listing them all, so I just wonâ€™t. I know itâ€™s been said before, but part of the beauty of lofi is that there isnâ€™t some rigid sort of outline of what types of music and instruments can go into making it. If youâ€™d like to actually make lofi then all you really need is a basic PC and some audio editing software (but it should be noted that chilled out vibes and anime gifs come separately)!</p>
